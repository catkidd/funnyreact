                    >, also known as the Monkey Temple, is an ancient Buddhist
                    temple complex located in Kathmandu, Nepal. The temple is
                    considered to be one of the most sacred Buddhist sites in
                    Nepal, and is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. <br />

                    The origins of the temple are said to date back to the 5th
                    century, although it is likely that the complex was built on
                    an even older sacred site. According to legend, the temple
                    was built by the monkey king, Manjushree, who is said to
                    have used his divine powers to cut a passage through a
                    nearby hill, revealing the natural pond that still exists
                    within the temple complex. The temple was later expanded and
                    renovated by various rulers throughout the centuries,
                    including the Licchavi kings of the 4th century and the
                    Malla kings of the 14th century. <br />

                    Swayambhunath is also known for its striking architecture,
                    which is a blend of traditional Nepalese and Tibetan styles.
                    The temple complex is made up of several temples, shrines,
                    and statues, including the main stupa, which is a large,
                    dome-shaped structure that is covered in gold and painted
                    with the eyes of the Buddha. The temple also features
                    intricate carvings, colorful prayer flags, and other
                    decorative elements that make it a truly unique and
                    beautiful place to visit. <br />

                    The temple complex is also home to a large population of
                    monkeys, which is where it gets its nickname "Monkey
                    Temple." These monkeys are considered sacred and are
                    protected by the temple authorities. Visitors can feed and
                    observe the monkeys, but they should be cautious as they can
                    be quite aggressive and should be avoided when they are
                    hungry. <br />

                    Swayambhunath is one of the most important tourist
                    attractions in Nepal, attracting thousands of visitors each
                    year. The temple is considered to be one of the best places
                    to gain an understanding of Buddhism and the culture of
                    Nepal, and it is also a popular spot for taking photographs,
                    especially at sunset when the temple is bathed in a
                    beautiful golden light.
